# Concurrent-HTTP-Server

This project implements an HTTP Server, which
1) serves static files and directories from local file system
2) support HTTP/1.0 protocol, multiple MIME types including HTML, TXT, JavaScript, CSS, PNG, and JPG files
3) only support GET requests

5) bases only on client/server socket operations (e.g. ServerSocket in Java)
6) is tested with auto-testing scripts and/or tools along with real browser tests
7) is benchmarked by ab
6) is written in Java
